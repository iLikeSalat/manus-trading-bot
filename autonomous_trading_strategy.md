# Autonomous Trading Strategy Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for transforming the existing signal-based trading bot into a fully autonomous trading system using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The system will be capable of making trading decisions independently based on market data, without relying on external signals.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The autonomous trading system will consist of the following components:

1. **Data Pipeline**: Collects and processes market data from Binance
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transforms raw market data into meaningful features
3. **RL Model**: Makes trading decisions based on the processed features
4. **Execution Engine**: Executes trades on Binance Futures
5. **Risk Management**: Controls position sizing and risk exposure
6. **Performance Tracking**: Monitors and evaluates trading performance

### 2.2 Component Interaction Flow

```
Market Data → Data Pipeline → Feature Engineering → RL Model → Trading Decision → Execution Engine → Binance Futures
                                                     ↑                             ↓
                                                     |                             |
                                      Performance Tracking ← Risk Management ←-----+
```

The state space will be a 30-dimensional vector representing the current market state, as described in the Feature Engineering section.

### 5.3 Action Space

The action space will be discrete with three possible actions:
1. **Buy**: Enter a long position
2. **Sell**: Enter a short position
3. **Hold**: No position or maintain current position

### 5.4 Neural Network Architecture

1. **Policy Network**:
   - Input Layer: 30 neurons (one for each feature)
   - Hidden Layers: 3 hidden layers with 128, 64, and 32 neurons respectively
   - Output Layer: 3 neurons (one for each action) with softmax activation

2. **Value Network**:
   - Input Layer: 30 neurons (one for each feature)
   - Hidden Layers: 3 hidden layers with 128, 64, and 32 neurons respectively
   - Output Layer: 1 neuron (state value estimation)

8. **Number of Epochs**: 10
9. **Update Interval**: Every 2048 steps

## 6. Reward Function

### 6.1 Primary Reward Components

1. **PnL-based Reward**: Realized and unrealized profit and loss
   - R_pnl = (current_portfolio_value - previous_portfolio_value) / previous_portfolio_value

2. **Risk-adjusted Reward**: Sharpe ratio component
   - R_sharpe = mean_return / (std_return + epsilon)

3. **Drawdown Penalty**: Penalize large drawdowns
   - R_drawdown = -max(0, (max_portfolio_value - current_portfolio_value) / max_portfolio_value - threshold)

### 6.2 Secondary Reward Components

1. **Trading Frequency Penalty**: Discourage overtrading
   - R_freq = -lambda_freq * (num_trades / max_trades)

2. **Holding Time Reward**: Encourage holding profitable positions
   - R_hold = lambda_hold * (holding_time / max_holding_time) * sign(position_pnl)

3. **Spread Cost Penalty**: Account for trading costs
   - R_cost = -lambda_cost * (bid_ask_spread / avg_spread)

### 6.3 Combined Reward Function

The final reward function will be a weighted combination of the above components:

R = w1 * R_pnl + w2 * R_sharpe - w3 * R_drawdown - w4 * R_freq + w5 * R_hold - w6 * R_cost

Initial weights will be:
- w1 = 1.0 (PnL)
- w2 = 0.5 (Sharpe)
- w3 = 1.0 (Drawdown)
- w4 = 0.3 (Trading Frequency)
- w5 = 0.2 (Holding Time)
- w6 = 0.4 (Spread Cost)

These weights can be tuned during hyperparameter optimization.
